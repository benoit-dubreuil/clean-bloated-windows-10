# Clean Bloated Windows 10

## Kill Bloat Processes
In the `kill_bloat_processes` directory, execute the `auto_kill_all.bat` batch file to call all batch files inside the `kill_bloat_processes/commands/` directory. Each one of these batch files *kill* all processes related to an application / service.
