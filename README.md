## Kill Bloat Processes

In the [kill_bloat_processes](clean_bloat_processes/kill_bloat_processes) directory, execute the [auto_kill_all.bat](clean_bloat_processes/kill_bloat_processes/auto_kill_all.bat) batch file to call all batch files inside the [commands](clean_bloat_processes/kill_bloat_processes/commands) directory. Each one of these batch files kills all processes related to an application / service.
